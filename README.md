# Jinsho's Playground Repo

**Nobody is born knowing anything.**  
It couldn’t be different with me! 🤷‍♂️  
Here is my repo where I practice my stuff. You can find every kind of thing here. Don't get stirred, though! 😅 
Here is not a place for professional, elite code. It’s the place I build knowledge to actually build those things!

You won’t find anything “serious” here, just treat it like a repo 4fun.  
**Why do I have a repo for this, you ask?**  
Oh, that’s simple. Reviewing trivial stuff. Never a good idea to keep all your files locally. Here is my one of my code cloud!

Anyway, if you're interested in seeing things around, I don’t think there’s much to see, but hey, there’s no one stopping you from looking.
